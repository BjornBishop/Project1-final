            <h4><u>Near-Shore Success</u></h4>
            <p>
                Although many felt the joy of working from home during the pandemic, often times these days, companies
                are requesting
                people come back to the office to build more committed teams. Having said that, there are increasing
                opportunities of
                clients looking to reduce overheads by having consultants working from near-shore locations. These often
                involve freelancers
                working from home 99% of the time with occassional visists to the company country. When and where
                possible, we push clients
                to take advantage of the remote setup and give you the flexbility you so deserve.

            <p>
                With the compounding demand for businesses to move their operations into the cloud, there has been an increase in 
                overall demand for those that can competently operate the facilities. A well known cloud provider was looking to 
                expand their capabilities with state of the art facilities and needed 60 datacenter technicians to drive the 
                project. The technicians we helped place have originate from all over EMEA and are still working today.
